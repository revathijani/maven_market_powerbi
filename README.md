# About The Project
Maven Market is a multinational grocery chain operating 24 stores across three countries: 13 in the USA, 9 in Mexico, and 2 in Canada. This project delivers an in-depth analysis of sales, customer behavior, and store performance for a multinational grocery chain operating 24 stores across the USA (13), Mexico (9), and Canada (2). This project focuses on analyzing data from 1998 to uncover key insights into financial performance, customer behavior, and store operations across regions. The interactive dashboard provides actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making, offering a detailed view of sales trends, customer preferences, and store performance across all regions.

# Data Cleaning
I applied ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, utilizing tools like Power BI to efficiently clean, transform, and load the data. This preparation ensured the dataset was ready for analysis and visualization, allowing for smooth, accurate insights into Maven Marketâ€™s 1998 sales performance across multiple regions. The data cleaning process included the following steps:

* Header Promotion: Ensured that the first row of data is used as the header for better clarity.
Data Type Formatting: Adjusted data types to ensure accurate analysis and compatibility with Power BI.
Calculated Columns: Added new calculated fields to facilitate deeper insights.
Null Value Replacement: Addressed missing data by replacing null values appropriately.
Column Merging and Extraction: Combined and extracted relevant columns to streamline the dataset.
Folder Data Import: Employed the "Folder" option to append multiple related datasets efficiently.
Data Trimming: Removed unnecessary whitespace from the dataset for cleaner data presentation.
Standardization: Standardized column names, date formats, and currency to maintain consistency throughout the dataset.
Data Profiling: Conducted data profiling to ensure quality assurance and identify any data anomalies on the entire dataset.
Removal of Unwanted Columns and Duplicates: Cleared out irrelevant columns and eliminated duplicate entries to refine the dataset
